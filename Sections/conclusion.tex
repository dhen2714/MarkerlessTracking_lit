At the beginning of this chapter, it was established that accuracy was the most important factor in determining a suitable markerless motion tracking system for MRI of the head. Submillimetre accuracy has been demonstrated for stereo vision \parencite{Kyme2014}, structured light \parencite{Olesen2012} and ToF \parencite{Noonan2015} systems.
