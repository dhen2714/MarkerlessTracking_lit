Time of flight (ToF) systems are similar to structured light systems in their use of a projected light source and a detector to create surface maps. Unlike structured light systems however, ToF systems use amplitude or phase changes of projected light in the time domain to extract depth information, rather than in the spatial domain. Reviews on ToF systems include \cite{Horaud2016} and \cite{tofbook}
