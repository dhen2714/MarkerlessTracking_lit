abstract = {We provide a review of recent advances in 3D surface imaging technologies. We focus particularly on noncontact 3D surface measurement techniques based on structured illumination. The high-speed and high-resolution pattern projection capability offered by the digital light projection technology, together with the recent advances in imaging sensor technologies, may enable new generation systems for 3D surface measurement applications that will provide much better functionality and performance than existing ones in terms of speed, accuracy, resolution, modularization, and ease of use. Performance indexes of 3D imaging system are discussed, and various 3D surface imaging schemes are categorized, illustrated, and compared. Calibration techniques are also discussed, since they play critical roles in achieving the required precision. Numerous applications of 3D surface imaging technologies are discussed with several examples.},

	abstract = {Coded structured light is considered one of the most reliable techniques for recovering the surface of objects. This technique is based on projecting a light pattern and viewing the illuminated scene from one or more points of view. Since the pattern is coded, correspondences between image points and points of the projected pattern can be easily found. The decoded points can be triangulated and 3D information is obtained. We present an overview of the existing techniques, as well as a new and definitive classification of patterns for structured light sensors. We have implemented a set of representative techniques in this field and present some comparative results. The advantages and constraints of the different patterns are also discussed. ?? 2003 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Huang1999,
	abstract = {A color-encoded digital fringe projection technique is proposed for$\backslash$nhigh-speed 3-D surface contouring applications. In this technique,$\backslash$na color fringe pattern whose RGB components comprise three phase-shifted$\backslash$nfringe patterns is created by software on a computer screen and$\backslash$nthen projected to an object by a novel computer-controlled digital$\backslash$nprojection system. The image of the object is captured by a digital$\backslash$ncamera positioned at an angle different from that of the projection$\backslash$nsystem. The image is then separated into its RGB components, creating$\backslash$nthree phase-shifted images of the object. These three images are$\backslash$nused to retrieve the 3-D surface contour of the object through the$\backslash$nuse of a phase wrapping and unwrapping algorithm. Only one image$\backslash$nof the object is required to obtain the 3-D surface contour of the$\backslash$nobject. Thus contouring speed, limited only by the frame rate of$\backslash$nthe camera, can be dramatically increased as compared to that of$\backslash$nthe traditional phase-shifting techniques. The technique is especially$\backslash$nuseful in applications where the object being contoured is going$\backslash$nthrough quasi-static or dynamic changes. The principle of the technique$\backslash$nis described and some preliminary experimental results are presented.},

In contrast to the moire contouring technique, a grating pattern projected onto the object surface is Fourier-transformed and processed in its spatial frequency domain as well as in its space-signal domain. This technique has a much higher sensitivity than the conventional moire technique and is capable of fully automatic distinction between a depression and an elevation on the object surface. There is no requirement for assigning fringe orders and interpolating data in the regions between contour fringes. The technique is free from errors caused by spurious moire fringes generated by the higher harmonic components of the grating pattern.},
